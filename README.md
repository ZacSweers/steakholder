ðŸ¥© steakholder
==============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'stakeholder' with 'steakholder'.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/ZacSweers/steakholder/blob/master/Steakholder.crx?raw=true)

Every time I see someone refer to "stakeholders", I think I'd take them more seriously if it was about steak.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag Steakholder.crx into the page that appears.
